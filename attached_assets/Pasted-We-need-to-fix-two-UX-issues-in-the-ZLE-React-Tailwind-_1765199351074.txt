We need to fix two UX issues in the ZLE React + Tailwind shop.

BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING:
1) First analyze the current implementation.
2) If the behavior is already correct according to the goals below, DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES.
3) In that case, only return a clear summary of what you found.

Only if the current implementation does NOT meet the goals, apply the minimal necessary changes.

GOALS:
1) When navigating between pages (/, /shop, /story, /crew, /legal, /contact), the view must ALWAYS scroll to the top on route change (mobile + desktop).
2) The product detail view must:
   - have a clearly visible close “X” button,
   - have a reachable “Add to cart” CTA (not hidden below the viewport),
   - prevent the background page from scrolling while the modal is open,
   - behave well on mobile AND desktop.

Do NOT change colors, typography, hero section, legal pages, footer, or any other layout.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1 — ANALYZE (NO MODIFICATIONS)
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Find where routing is configured (App.tsx / router file).
   - Check if there is already a ScrollToTop-like component or equivalent logic.
   - Check what happens on / → /shop navigation (does it scroll to top or not?).

2. Find the product detail component (modal/card).
   - Identify how it is rendered (portal / inline).
   - Check:
     - is there already an X button?
     - is the CTA always visible?
     - does the background scroll when modal is open?

3. If ALL of the above already matches the stated GOALS:
   - DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE.
   - Just return a summary of the current implementation and explicitly say that no changes were needed.

If something does NOT meet the GOALS, continue to PHASE 2.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 — APPLY MINIMAL FIXES
────────────────────────────────────────

PART 1 — Scroll to top on every route change

1. If there is no existing reusable scroll-to-top logic, create a helper component:

client/src/components/layout/ScrollToTop.tsx

Content:

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

const ScrollToTop = () => {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: "auto" });
  }, [pathname]);
  return null;
};

export default ScrollToTop;

2. Inject <ScrollToTop /> inside the router, but outside all pages.

Example pattern in App.tsx or router file:

<BrowserRouter>
  <ScrollToTop />
  <MainLayout />
</BrowserRouter>

If an equivalent component already exists, reuse it instead of creating a duplicate.

Do NOT change page content or layout.

────────────────────────────────────────
PART 2 — Fix product detail modal (mobile + desktop)

1. Locate the component responsible for product detail (e.g. ProductDetail.tsx or ProductModal.tsx).

2. If it is NOT already a proper full-screen overlay:
   - Wrap the modal in a full-screen overlay:

<div
  className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/70"
  onClick={onClose}   // only if background click should close
>
  <div
    className="relative w-full max-w-md max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto rounded-2xl bg-zleBlack p-4 md:p-6"
    onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
  >
    {modal content}
  </div>
</div>

3. If there is no visible close button, add:

<button
  type="button"
  onClick={onClose}
  className="absolute right-4 top-4 text-2xl leading-none text-white/80 hover:text-white"
  aria-label="Zavřít"
>
  ×
</button>

4. If the “Add to cart” CTA can be hidden below the viewport, move it into a sticky bottom action bar INSIDE the modal card:

<div className="sticky bottom-0 left-0 right-0 mt-4 bg-zleBlack/95 border-t border-white/10 p-4 flex flex-col gap-3 sm:flex-row">
  {existing "Add to cart" button}
</div>

Re-use the existing button component and props. Do NOT rename it and do NOT change its logic.

5. Ensure:
   - the modal container has max-h-[90vh] + overflow-y-auto,
   - scrolling happens inside the modal, not in the background page.

Apply only the changes that are necessary. If some parts already behave correctly, leave them as they are.

────────────────────────────────────────
VERIFY
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Navigating to /shop and other routes always starts at the top of the page.
2. Opening a product:
   - Close (X) button is visible immediately (mobile + desktop).
   - The “Add to cart” button is visible or reachable without being hidden off-screen.
   - Background does not scroll while modal is open.
3. Desktop layout remains visually the same except for the improved modal behavior.

────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY OUTPUT (REQUIRED)
────────────────────────────────────────

In all cases, whether you changed something or not, return:

- File path of the modal component.
- File path where ScrollToTop (or equivalent) is located/used.
- Whether any files were modified, and if yes:
  - which ones,
  - what changed in behavior from the user’s perspective.

If no changes were needed, explicitly state that the current implementation already meets all GOALS.
